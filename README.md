# Practice project

### Become a better frontend developer.

This idea came to me from some sites that encourage practice and challenges like :

- [Frontend Practice](https://www.frontendpractice.com/)
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

So I came up with an idea to do this thing in addition to memorizing everything I practice to be a reference for me later as a small templates.
